V1 - it calculates safe values for the breeding of fish in tanks equipped with bead filters.

All values and calculations are based in information provided by Dr. Ron Malone, and are suitable for, and tested with fish tanks equipped with bead filters, or filters that use floating media for its process of water purification.


V2 - it calculates safe values for the breeding of fish in tanks equipped with bead filters, and also can calculate the weight of a fish based in its length, and from the result calculates the amount of ammonia produced in 24 hours by this fish.

All values and calculations are based in information provided by Dr. Ron Malone, and are suitable for, and tested with fish tanks equipped with bead filters, or filters that use floating media for its process of water purification.
The formula for the calculus of the weight can be found in the Chapter 17 of the Manual of Fisheries Survey Methods II (january, 2000), and was tested with a table of fish length/weigth in Russell Watergardens & Koi web site, in wich can also be found the relation between weight and ammonia production.

More features soon.
