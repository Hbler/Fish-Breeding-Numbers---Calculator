# Fish Breeding Numbers

# Calculates safe values for the breeding of fish in tanks equipped with bead filters.

# 1. Request weigh of fish in the tank. 

fWeigh = input ('Type the weigh of fish in the tank in Lbs (pounds): >> ')


# 2. Calculates the feeding rate

feedRate = fWeigh * 0.015


# 3. Calculates the tank size.

tSize = feedRate * 200


# 4. Calculates the necessary volume of beads in the filter.

bVolume = feedRate * 0.67


# 5. Calculates the adequate recirculation flow.

flowRate = feedRate * 7.5

# 6. Presents the results in a way that the user can easily identify.
